Centipede Game in C++ using SFML

This project is a classic-style Centipede arcade game built with C++ and the SFML library for graphics, audio, and event handling. The player controls a shooter that can move horizontally and vertically within a restricted area at the bottom of the screen and shoot bullets to destroy a centipede crawling across the playfield. Mushrooms act as obstacles and interact with both bullets and centipede segments. The game features real-time collision detection, a scoring system, background music, and sound effects for various in-game actions. It is a complete implementation of core game development concepts like sprite handling, user input, animations, and game logic in C++, and serves as a great learning project for students exploring SFML or 2D game development.
